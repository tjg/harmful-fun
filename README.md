# harmful-fun

Our little project. Let's draw a moving ball!
Maybe add a sound when it bounces.

## Usage

Open [`src/my_sketch/core.clj`](https://github.com/tjg/harmful-fun/blob/master/src/harmful_fun/core.clj) in Light Table. Execute it. You should see a canvas pop up with something moving!


## Thoughts

- We made little changes and saw what happened. We don't need complete
  understanding, or seeing far ahead.

- We may simplify our code further, especially if we notice that
  we repeated ourselves. Often leads to insights.
